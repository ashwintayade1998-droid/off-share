## 1. Project Overview

**OffShare** is a **peer-to-peer, offline file transfer** application for Android. It allows two devices to exchange files over a direct Wi-Fi connection — _without internet, without cloud services, without Bluetooth_.

### How It Works (High Level)

1. The **Sender** device creates a local Wi-Fi hotspot (`LocalOnlyHotspot` API) and starts an HTTP file server (NanoHTTPD) on port `3000`.
2. The Sender's screen displays a **QR code** containing the hotspot SSID, password, server IP, and port.
3. The **Receiver** scans the QR code, auto-connects to the Sender's hotspot, and downloads files directly over the LAN.
4. Files are saved to the Receiver's `Download/OffShare/` folder via Android's **Storage Access Framework (SAF)**.

### Key Features

- 🚫 **No Internet Required** — Fully offline, peer-to-peer transfer
- 🔒 **Secure LAN Transfer** — Data stays on the local network, never leaves the device
- 📸 **QR Code Connection** — Zero manual configuration; scan and connect
- 📂 **Multi-File Support** — Select and transfer multiple files at once
- 📊 **Progress Tracking** — Real-time per-file and overall progress indicators
- 🔄 **Auto Wi-Fi Join** — Receiver automatically connects to the Sender's hotspot
- 💾 **SAF Integration** — Files saved to public Downloads, visible in the system file manager

## 2. Why Expo + React Native?

### The Problem

OffShare needs to be an Android app that does heavy native operations (hotspot creation, Wi-Fi network joining, HTTP server, file system access) while also having a polished, modern UI with animations, state transitions, and real-time progress updates.

### Why React Native?

| Reason                                  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Rapid UI Development**          | React Native provides a component-based UI model with JSX, making it significantly faster to build complex screens (state-machine UIs, progress bars, animations) than native Android XML/Compose.        |
| **JavaScript for Business Logic** | The transfer state machine, QR data encoding/decoding, permission flow orchestration, and UI state management are all complex logic tasks that benefit from JavaScript's flexibility and rapid iteration. |
| **Native Bridge**                 | React Native's `NativeModules` bridge allows us to call Kotlin code directly from JavaScript. This is critical because OffShare needs low-level Android APIs that don't have JavaScript equivalents.    |
| **Cross-Platform Potential**      | While OffShare is currently Android-only, React Native provides a path to iOS in the future without rewriting the UI layer.                                                                               |
| **Hot Reload**                    | During development, React Native's Fast Refresh enables instant UI changes without rebuilding the APK — dramatically speeding up UI/UX iteration.                                                        |

### Why Expo?

| Reason                             | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managed Toolchain**        | Expo provides pre-configured build tools, Metro bundler, and development server out of the box. No manual Gradle/Metro/Babel configuration needed.                                                                                                                              |
| **Expo Modules**             | OffShare uses several Expo modules that provide battle-tested, well-maintained native functionality:`expo-camera` (QR scanning), `expo-document-picker` (file selection), `expo-file-system` (cache management, SAF access), `expo-location` (location services check). |
| **Development Builds**       | With `expo-dev-client`, we run a custom development build that includes our Kotlin native modules while still getting the Expo developer experience (dev menu, error overlays, fast refresh).                                                                                 |
| **Build System**             | `expo run:android` handles the full native build pipeline — Gradle, dexing, APK generation — with a single command.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **New Architecture Support** | The project has `newArchEnabled: true` in `app.json`, opting into React Native's New Architecture (Fabric renderer) for improved performance.                                                                                                                               |

### Why Not Pure Native (Kotlin/Jetpack Compose)?

While a pure native app could achieve the same functionality, React Native + Expo was chosen because:

- The UI layer (3 screens with complex state machines, animations, progress bars) would take **significantly longer** to build and iterate on in native Android.
- The core native logic (hotspot, server, Wi-Fi, SAF) is already written in Kotlin and accessed via the bridge — we get the **best of both worlds**.
- The Expo ecosystem provides ready-made solutions for camera (QR scanning), document picking, and file system access that would otherwise require manual implementation.

---

## 3. Why Kotlin for Native Modules?

### The Technical Necessity

React Native and Expo provide excellent UI and many common native features, but **OffShare requires low-level Android system APIs** that have no JavaScript equivalent and no existing Expo/RN library support:

| Feature                                 | Android API Required                               | Why JS Can't Do This                                                                                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Wi-Fi Hotspot**                 | `WifiManager.startLocalOnlyHotspot()`            | Android system API — requires direct access to `WifiManager` service                                                                                  |
| **HTTP File Server**              | NanoHTTPD (JVM library)                            | Needed an in-process HTTP server that can serve files from the filesystem. No JS equivalent that runs embedded in an Android app.                        |
| **Wi-Fi Network Joining**         | `WifiNetworkSpecifier` + `ConnectivityManager` | Programmatic Wi-Fi connection with process network binding requires Android `ConnectivityManager` APIs (API 29+)                                       |
| **SAF File Copy**                 | `ContentResolver.openOutputStream()`             | Writing to SAF `content://` URIs requires native `ContentResolver` access. JS-side base64 encoding would cause out-of-memory crashes on large files. |
| **Media Scanner**                 | `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()`              | Making downloaded files visible in the system Gallery/Files app requires triggering the Android MediaScanner service                                     |
| **Network Interface Enumeration** | `java.net.NetworkInterface`                      | Detecting the IP address of the hotspot interface requires iterating JVM `NetworkInterface` objects                                                    |

### Why Kotlin Specifically (vs Java)?

- **Kotlin is the official Android language** — Google recommends it for all new Android development.
- **Null safety** — Critical for code that deals with system callbacks that may return null (hotspot config, network interfaces).
- **Concise syntax** — Kotlin's `when` expressions, extension functions, and data classes make the native code significantly more readable.
- **Expo/RN ecosystem alignment** — Expo's own native modules and the React Native template both use Kotlin by default.

## 4. Kotlin Native Modules — Deep Dive

All native Kotlin files are located at:

```
android/app/src/main/java/com/seven1111/offshare/
```

### 4.1 `FileServer.kt`

**Purpose:** The core HTTP file server powered by [NanoHTTPD](https://github.com/NanoHttpd/nanohttpd).

**What it does:**

- Extends `NanoHTTPD` to create an embedded HTTP server that runs inside the Android app.
- Exposes three endpoints:
  - `GET /ping` — Health check. Returns `{"status": "ok"}`. Used by the Receiver to verify the Sender is reachable.
  - `GET /files` — Returns a JSON array of all shared files with their names and sizes. Also triggers the `onReceiverConnected` callback on first request (detects when a Receiver connects).
  - `GET /download?name=<filename>` — Serves a specific file as a binary download (`application/octet-stream`). URL-decodes the filename parameter to handle spaces and special characters.
- Handles file name matching by comparing the decoded `name` query parameter against the list of `File` objects provided at construction.

**Why Kotlin is required:** NanoHTTPD is a JVM library — it can only run in the JVM/Dalvik runtime, not in the JS engine. An in-process HTTP server is essential because the Receiver connects directly to this server over the LAN.

---

### 4.2 `FileServerModule.kt`

**Purpose:** The React Native bridge module that exposes the file server functionality to JavaScript.

**Exposed methods (callable from JS via `NativeModules.FileServer`):**

| Method                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `startServer(port, filePaths)` | Starts the NanoHTTPD server on the given port, serving the specified file paths. Cleans up any previous server instance. Validates that files exist on disk before serving. Fires `onReceiverConnected` event when a Receiver hits the `/files` endpoint.                                                                                          |
| `stopServer()`                 | Stops the running server gracefully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `getLocalIPv4()`               | Detects the device's best local IPv4 address for the hotspot interface. Uses a sophisticated selection algorithm that prioritizes Wi-Fi/hotspot interfaces (`wlan`, `swlan`, `ap`, `softap`) and private LAN ranges (`192.168.x.x`, `10.x.x.x`, `172.16-31.x.x`). Excludes cellular (`rmnet`), VPN (`tun`), and loopback interfaces. |
| `dumpNetworkInterfaces()`      | Debug utility that returns ALL network interfaces with their IPs, up/down status, and loopback flag. Used during development to diagnose IP detection issues.                                                                                                                                                                                          |

**Why Kotlin is required:**

- `java.net.NetworkInterface` enumeration for IP detection is a JVM-only API.
- The module manages the lifecycle of the `FileServer` instance (start/stop) and bridges native events (`onReceiverConnected`) to JavaScript.

---

### 4.3 `FileServerPackage.kt`

**Purpose:** React Native package registration file. This is the glue that tells React Native about all custom native modules.

**What it does:**

- Implements `ReactPackage` interface.
- Registers all five custom native modules in `createNativeModules()`:
  1. `FileServerModule`
  2. `HotspotManager`
  3. `WifiConnectorModule`
  4. `MediaScannerModule`
  5. `SafTransferModule`
- This package is added to React Native's package list in `MainApplication.kt`.

**Why it exists:** React Native's module system requires a `ReactPackage` to discover and instantiate native modules. Without this file, none of the Kotlin modules would be accessible from JavaScript.

---

### 4.4 `HotspotManager.kt`

**Purpose:** Manages the Android `LocalOnlyHotspot` lifecycle — creating and destroying a Wi-Fi hotspot that other devices can connect to.

**Exposed methods (callable from JS via `NativeModules.HotspotManager`):**

| Method                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `startHotspot()`      | Calls `WifiManager.startLocalOnlyHotspot()` to create a temporary Wi-Fi hotspot. Waits 1500ms after the `onStarted` callback for the network interface to fully initialize. Returns the SSID and password (auto-generated by Android). Fires `onHotspotStarted` event to JS. |
| `stopHotspot()`       | Closes the hotspot reservation, shutting down the hotspot. Fires `onHotspotStopped` event.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `isHotspotRunning()`  | Returns whether a hotspot reservation is currently active.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `isLocationEnabled()` | Checks if GPS or Network location provider is enabled (required by Android before `LocalOnlyHotspot` can start).                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Why Kotlin is required:**

- `LocalOnlyHotspot` is an Android system API (`WifiManager`) that requires native access. There is no JavaScript or Expo equivalent.
- The callback-based API (`LocalOnlyHotspotCallback.onStarted`, `.onFailed`, `.onStopped`) must run on the Android main thread (`Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())`).
- Security exceptions (missing location permission) need to be caught and translated to user-friendly error messages.

**Key implementation details:**

- Uses `LocalOnlyHotspot` (not traditional tethering) — this is a modern API (Android 8.0+) that creates an isolated network specifically for app-to-app communication. It does NOT require the user to manually go into settings.
- The SSID and password are **auto-generated by Android** — the app cannot control them. This is why we use a QR code to transmit the credentials.
- The 1500ms delay after `onStarted` is intentional — the network interface needs time to fully bind and become routable.

---

### 4.5 `WifiConnectorModule.kt`

**Purpose:** Programmatically connects the Receiver device to the Sender's hotspot and binds all network traffic to that Wi-Fi connection.

**Exposed methods (callable from JS via `NativeModules.WifiConnector`):**

| Method                               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `connectToHotspot(ssid, password)` | Uses `WifiNetworkSpecifier` (Android 10+) to request a connection to the Sender's hotspot. After connecting, calls `cm.bindProcessToNetwork(network)` to force all HTTP traffic through the Wi-Fi connection (instead of mobile data). Includes a 30-second timeout. |
| `clearNetworkBinding()`            | Unbinds the process from the Wi-Fi network, returning to default routing (mobile data).**Must** be called after transfer completes.                                                                                                                                |
| `isNetworkBound()`                 | Returns whether the process is currently bound to a specific network.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**Why Kotlin is required:**

- `WifiNetworkSpecifier` and `ConnectivityManager.requestNetwork()` are Android-only APIs (API 29+).
- **Process network binding** (`bindProcessToNetwork`) is critical: without it, Android would route HTTP requests through mobile data instead of the local hotspot, making the Sender's server unreachable.
- The `NetworkCallback` system (`onAvailable`, `onUnavailable`, `onLost`) is a native Android callback pattern that must be handled in Kotlin.

**Key implementation details:**

- Pre-flight checks verify all required permissions (`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` on Android 13+) and that Location Services are enabled.
- `removeCapability(NET_CAPABILITY_INTERNET)` tells Android this network doesn't need internet access — without this, Android might reject the connection since `LocalOnlyHotspot` networks have no internet.
- Previous network callbacks are cleaned up before new requests to avoid resource leaks.

### 4.6 `SafTransferModule.kt`

**Purpose:** Performs native file copying from a temporary cache file to a Storage Access Framework (SAF) `content://` URI.

**Exposed methods (callable from JS via `NativeModules.SafTransfer`):**

| Method                                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `copyFileToContentUri(sourceUri, destContentUri)` | Reads from a source file (cache location) and writes to a SAF destination URI using a 256KB buffer. Handles both `file://` and `content://` source URIs. Returns the number of bytes copied. |

**Why Kotlin is required:**

- SAF URIs (`content://com.android.externalstorage.documents/...`) can only be written to via `ContentResolver.openOutputStream()` — a native Android API.
- The **critical reason** this module exists: without it, the JS layer would have to read the entire file as a base64 string and write it via `expo-file-system`. For large files (videos, archives), this would cause **out-of-memory (OOM) crashes** because base64 encoding inflates file size by ~33% and loads the entire string into memory.
- The native streaming approach (256KB buffer) keeps memory usage constant regardless of file size.

**Key implementation details:**

- `openSourceInputStream` handles edge cases with URI encoding — Android may return paths with percent-encoded characters (e.g., `%2C` for commas). The method tries multiple path candidates to find the actual file on disk.
- Uses `linkedSetOf` to deduplicate path candidates while preserving order.

---

### 4.7 `MediaScannerModule.kt`

**Purpose:** Triggers the Android MediaScanner on downloaded files so they appear in the system file manager, Gallery, and other media apps.

**Exposed methods (callable from JS via `NativeModules.MediaScanner`):**

| Method                   | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scanFile(filePath)`   | Scans a single file path. The file becomes visible in the system's media database.                                  |
| `scanFiles(filePaths)` | Batch-scans multiple file paths at once. Resolves immediately — scanning happens asynchronously in the background. |

**Why Kotlin is required:**

- `MediaScannerConnection.scanFile()` is an Android system API. Without triggering it, downloaded files would exist on disk but **would NOT appear** in the user's file browser or gallery until the next system-wide media scan (which could be hours later).

---

### 4.8 `MainApplication.kt`

**Purpose:** The Android Application class — the entry point for the entire app.

**What it does:**

- Extends `Application` and implements `ReactApplication`.
- Configures the `ReactNativeHost` with:
  - Expo's `ReactNativeHostWrapper` for module lifecycle management.
  - The `FileServerPackage()` registration (which brings in all 5 custom native modules).
  - New Architecture (Fabric) support based on build config.
- Initializes Expo's `ApplicationLifecycleDispatcher` for Expo module lifecycle hooks.

**Why Kotlin is required:** This is a mandatory Android application file that must be written in a JVM language. It's the bootstrap point where our custom `FileServerPackage` is registered with React Native.

---

### 4.9 `MainActivity.kt`

**Purpose:** The single Android Activity that hosts the React Native view.

**What it does:**

- Sets the app theme (`AppTheme`) before `onCreate` to support the splash screen.
- Registers the main React Native component name (`"main"`).
- Configures the `ReactActivityDelegate` with New Architecture (Fabric) support.
- Handles back button behavior (moves to background on Android S+ instead of finishing the activity).

**Why Kotlin is required:** Android requires at least one `Activity` — this is the container that React Native renders into. Uses Expo's `ReactActivityDelegateWrapper` for compatibility with Expo modules.

## 5. JavaScript Screen Files — Deep Dive

All screen files are located at:

```
src/screens/
```

### 5.1 `App.js`

**Location:** `./App.js` (root)

**Purpose:** Root application component and navigation controller.

**What it does:**

- Manages the current screen state using `useState` — one of: `'home'`, `'share'`, `'receive'`.
- Renders the appropriate screen component based on the current state:
  - `home` → `HomeScreen`
  - `share` → `ShareScreen`
  - `receive` → `ReceiveScreen`
- Sets the status bar style (light text) and background color.
- Passes navigation callbacks to child screens:
  - `onSelectRole` to `HomeScreen` — navigates to share or receive.
  - `onBack` to `ShareScreen` and `ReceiveScreen` — returns to home.

**Design decision:** Instead of using React Navigation (a routing library), the app uses a simple `switch` statement for navigation. This is intentional — the app only has 3 screens, so a full router would be unnecessary overhead.

---

### 5.2 `HomeScreen.js`

**Location:** `src/screens/HomeScreen.js`

**Purpose:** The landing screen — lets the user choose between **sending** or **receiving** files.

**What it does:**

- Displays the app branding (⚡ icon + "OffShare" title) at the top.
- Shows two large, tappable cards:
  - **"Share Files"** — with an upload icon. Tapping navigates to `ShareScreen`.
  - **"Receive Files"** — with a radar icon. Tapping navigates to `ReceiveScreen`.
- Uses the app's design system (`COLORS`, `STYLES` from `theme.js`) for consistent dark-themed styling.

**UI elements:**

- Cards have a dark background (`#161B22`), rounded corners, subtle borders (`#30363D`), and elevation shadows.
- Icons use Expo's `MaterialCommunityIcons` from `@expo/vector-icons`.

---

### 5.3 `ShareScreen.js`

**Location:** `src/screens/ShareScreen.js`

**Purpose:** The **Sender** flow — handles file selection, hotspot creation, server startup, QR code display, and transfer monitoring.

**This is the most complex screen in the app.** It implements a full state machine with 10 states.

#### State Machine

```
idle → filesSelected → serverStarting → hotspotStarting → hotspotReady →
networkReady → waitingForReceiver → connected → sending → completed
```

Any state can also transition to `error`.

#### Key Functions

| Function                     | What It Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pickFiles()`              | Opens Expo's document picker (`expo-document-picker`) for multi-file selection. Copies selected files to the app's cache directory (`offshare/`) to ensure stable file paths. Decodes URI-encoded paths (e.g., `%20` → spaces) for correct filesystem access.                    |
| `requestPermissions()`     | Requests Android runtime permissions:`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, and `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES` (Android 13+). Shows a settings redirect if permissions are denied.                                                                                              |
| `ensureLocationServices()` | Checks if GPS/Network Location is enabled via `HotspotManager.isLocationEnabled()`. Shows a blocking alert directing the user to Location Settings if disabled.                                                                                                                       |
| `startSharing()`           | **The main flow orchestrator.** Executes sequentially: (1) request permissions → (2) check location services → (3) start `LocalOnlyHotspot` via `HotspotManager` → (4) start NanoHTTPD server via `FileServer` → (5) detect local IPv4 → (6) generate QR code payload. |
| `stopSharing()`            | Stops the server and hotspot, resets all state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `logNetworkInterfaces()`   | Debug utility that calls `FileServer.dumpNetworkInterfaces()` and logs all network interfaces to the console.                                                                                                                                                                         |

#### QR Code Payload

The QR code encodes a JSON object:

```json
{
  "ssid": "DIRECT-Xx-ANDROID-<hash>",
  "password": "<auto-generated>",
  "ip": "192.168.x.x",
  "port": 3000,
  "filesEndpoint": "/files",
  "downloadEndpoint": "/download",
  "deviceName": "OffShare Sender"
}
```

#### UI Sections

1. **Header** — Back button + "Share Files" title.
2. **Step Indicator** — Four dots (Files → Server → Hotspot → Receiver) showing progress through the flow.
3. **Status Banner** — Dynamic status text showing current operation.
4. **File Picker Card** — Shows selected files with names, sizes, and a "Choose Files" button. Supports adding/removing files.
5. **"Start Sharing" Button** — Triggers the full sharing flow.
6. **Processing Indicator** — Animated loading spinner shown during hotspot/server startup.
7. **QR Code Display** — Shows the scannable QR code, hotspot credentials (SSID + password), and server address. Includes a pulse animation while waiting for the Receiver.
8. **Transfer Progress** — Overall progress bar and percentage (shown during active transfer).
9. **Stop/Reset Button** — Red outlined button to cancel or start a new transfer.

#### Animations

- **Pulse animation** — `Animated.loop` scale animation (1 → 1.3 → 1) on the radar icon while waiting for receiver.
- **Fade-in animation** — QR code fades in with `Animated.timing` (opacity 0 → 1).

---

### 5.4 `ReceiveScreen.js`

**Location:** `src/screens/ReceiveScreen.js`

**Purpose:** The **Receiver** flow — handles QR scanning, Wi-Fi connection, file list fetching, downloading, and SAF storage.

**This is the largest screen (1662 lines) and the most technically complex.** It handles the full receiver pipeline from QR scan to file download.

#### State Machine

```
idle → scanning → scanned → connecting → connected → receiving → complete
Any state can transition to → error
```

Valid transitions are enforced by a `VALID_TRANSITIONS` map — invalid transitions are logged and blocked.

#### Key Functions

| Function                           | What It Does                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `openScanner()`                  | Requests camera permission via `expo-camera`, then opens a full-screen QR scanner using `CameraView`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `handleBarCodeScanned({ data })` | Parses the scanned QR data using a robust multi-pass parser (`parseQRPayloadRobust`) that handles: raw JSON, double-stringified JSON, escaped strings, and quoted blobs. Validates the payload and extracts sender info. Auto-starts connection flow.                                                                                                                        |
| `beginConnection(senderInfo)`    | **The connection orchestrator.** Executes: (1) check permissions → (2) check location services → (3) try direct ping (fast-path if already on same network) → (4) join Wi-Fi hotspot via `WifiConnector.connectToHotspot()` → (5) validate LAN address → (6) ping sender server (8s timeout) → (7) fetch file list. Includes fallback logic if Wi-Fi join fails. |
| `ensureSafDirectory()`           | Gets the SAF directory for saving files. Uses a persisted URI cache (`saf_download_uri.txt`) so the user only picks the folder once. Pre-navigates to `Download/` folder.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `startReceiving()`               | **The download orchestrator.** For each file: (1) download to temp cache via `expo-file-system` → (2) create destination file via SAF → (3) stream-copy to SAF via `SafTransfer.copyFileToContentUri()` → (4) trigger media scan → (5) clean up temp file. Updates per-file and overall progress throughout.                                                     |
| `retryConnection()`              | Re-attempts the connection flow with the previously scanned sender info.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `resetTransfer()`                | Clears all state, unbinds network, returns to idle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

#### Utility Functions

| Function                                    | What It Does                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fetchWithTimeout(url, options, timeout)` | `fetch` wrapper with a hard timeout using `AbortController`. Prevents the app from hanging on network requests. Default: 8 seconds.                        |
| `isValidLanAddress(ip)`                   | Validates that an IP is a private LAN address (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x). Security check to prevent connecting to public IPs.                      |
| `validateQRPayload(parsed)`               | Validates the QR payload has all required fields (`ip`, `port`, `filesEndpoint`) and that the IP is a valid private LAN address.                         |
| `parseQRPayloadRobust(raw)`               | Multi-pass JSON parser with up to 5 unwrapping iterations. Handles corner cases from different QR scanner implementations that may double-encode the data.     |
| `sanitizeFileName(name)`                  | Strips illegal filesystem characters (`<>:"/\|?*`) from filenames.                                                                                            |
| `getSafBaseName(fileName)`                | Extracts the base name (without extension) for SAF file creation, since SAF auto-appends the extension based on MIME type.                                     |
| `getMimeType(fileName)`                   | Maps file extensions to MIME types for SAF file creation. Supports images, videos, audio, documents, and archives. Falls back to `application/octet-stream`. |
| `loadSavedSafUri()` / `saveSafUri(uri)` | Persists and loads the SAF directory URI to/from a cache file so the user doesn't have to re-pick the download folder every time.                              |

#### UI Sections

1. **Header** — Back button + "Receive Files" title.
2. **Step Indicator** — Three dots (Scan → Connect → Receive).
3. **Idle State** — Large "Scan QR Code" button with feature badges ("Auto Wi-Fi Connect", "Secure LAN Transfer").
4. **Full-Screen QR Scanner** — Uses `expo-camera`'s `CameraView` with a custom overlay (corner brackets, title, hint text).
5. **Scanned State** — Brief transition showing "QR Scanned!" with a spinner.
6. **Connecting State** — Shows detailed connection progress (sub-steps like "Joining Wi-Fi...", "Pinging sender...", "Fetching files...") with sender network info.
7. **Error State** — Contextual error display with type-specific icons and hints:
   - `wifi` error → "Wi-Fi Connection Failed" + Wi-Fi troubleshooting tips
   - `ping` error → "Cannot Reach Sender" + network connectivity advice
   - `download` error → "Download Failed"
   - Retry and Scan Again buttons
8. **Connected State** — File list with names, sizes, total size, and "Download All Files" button.
9. **Receiving/Complete State** — Overall progress bar, per-file progress with download indicators, "New Transfer" button on completion.

#### Error Recovery

The screen has robust error recovery:

- **Retry** — Re-attempts the connection flow without requiring a new QR scan.
- **Scan Again** — Full reset back to idle for a fresh scan.
- **Fallback ping** — If Wi-Fi hotspot join fails, attempts a direct ping to the sender's IP (handles cases where devices are already on the same network).
- **Network binding cleanup** — Always clears the network binding on error, completion, or unmount to prevent routing issues.

| `ACCESS_WIFI_STATE`             | Check current Wi-Fi state                                                          |
| `CHANGE_WIFI_STATE`             | Start `LocalOnlyHotspot`                                                         |
| `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE`          | Check network connectivity                                                         |
| `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`          | Required by Android to start `LocalOnlyHotspot` and use `WifiNetworkSpecifier` |
| `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`        | Backup location permission                                                         |
| `NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES`           | Required on Android 13+ for Wi-Fi operations                                       |
| `CAMERA`                        | QR code scanning on receiver side                                                  |
| `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`         | File access on Android ≤ 12                                                       |
| `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`        | File writing on Android ≤ 8                                                       |
| `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES/VIDEO/AUDIO` | Scoped media access on Android 13+                                                 |
| `VIBRATE`                       | Haptic feedback                                                                    |

**Additional manifest settings:**

- `android:usesCleartextTraffic="true"` — Required because the LAN HTTP server uses `http://` (not HTTPS). This is safe because the traffic never leaves the local network.
- `android:screenOrientation="portrait"` — Locked to portrait mode.
